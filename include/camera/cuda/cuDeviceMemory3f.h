class cuDeviceMemory

This class manages all cuda memory that is required for image processing within the 
TrackingExpert application. It is a global storage, which is integrated as a singleton to
maintain global access to the cuda device memory from different locations of the application.

It supports the following memory:

	- Input depth image device memory, DevInImagePtr()

	- point array that stores all points extracted from the depth image, DevPointPtr()
	- normal array that stores all normal vectors generated from the depth image per point, DevNormalsPtr()
	- point image, organizes all points as an image grid, DevPointImagePtr()
	- normal image, organizes all normal vectors as an image grid, DevNormalsImagePtr()

- Allocate new memory for temporary image data. 
- Addeda memory counter to keep track of allocated cuda memory;
